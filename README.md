My 3rd #hello-world on git project.

My name is #Mohd_Shahlan_Mohd_Shah
I have #zero knowledge about #github.
This is hard for me. Whatever in the
video and instruction page are obselete.
They renew github but not this session.

So I did some #google and watching youtube.
I want it to be #done. Do it in correct way.
I want to be #SUCCESS like other #programmer

I come to #codeworld with #zero-knowledge.
I learn programming #online. I take online
programming course. I search by #google. I
watch #video on #youtube. Messing around at
#Facebook. #Keep_on_the_determination.
#Keep_on_climb_to_the_tops. #SUCCESS..
I want to be success... 

I enrol online programming courses from
#Sololearn.#Grasshopper.#Programming-hub
#Codecademy.#W3school.

Whatis the sweet memories while learning?
When I got my #1st_certification_Sololearn.

Just like i was in my childhood.
Than I started to collect all my online

Moment in mylife.

#THANKS-to-SOLOLEARN.
